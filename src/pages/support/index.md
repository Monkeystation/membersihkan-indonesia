Cleanup Indonesia is an initiative with the sole purpose of creating awareness and offer solutions for the plastic problem in Indonesia. We hope to inspire people and governmental agencies to work on the much needed changes.

If you share our concerns and you want to do more, please consider a donation. Every donation will be fully utilised to bring our educational website under the attention of the local population, especially those living in remote areas in Indonesia. This will be done by means of social media advertising.

With your donations we can reach millions of people, which will result in a cleaner Indonesia, cleaner oceans, less plastic and good karma!
